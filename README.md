This game ask you to guess a randomly selected word. At the start of the game it will give you the number of letters in the word and ask you to guess a letter. You may also guess the word at any time. Correct, duplicate or invalid guesses do not count against the 6 attempts you have to guess the word however each incorrect guess will count against the 6 attempts. An invalid guess is attempting a word that does not have the same number of characters as the selected word or attempting an invalid character such as a number. When a duplicate letter is attempted a list of previously attempted letters will be displayed.
